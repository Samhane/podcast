### Code of Conduct

The Method requires all contributors to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please report unacceptable behavior to [contact.the.method@gmail.com](mailto:contact.the.method@gmail.com).

## How can I contribute?

Follow The Method's **Contribution Rules** to ensure we are creating a constructive conversation:

### Rule 1: **Be courteous.**
Demeaning language, sarcasm, rudeness, or hostility towards another contributor will get your contribution removed. 

### Rule 2: **Source your facts.**
If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up with a qualified source. There is no "common knowledge" exception.

### Rule 3: **Put thought into it.**
Explain the reasoning behind what you're saying. Bare statements of opinion, off-topic contributions, and one-line replies will be removed. Argue your position with logic and evidence.

### Rule 4: **Address the arguments, not the person.**
The subject of your sentence should be "the evidence" or "this source" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. "You" statements are suspect.
