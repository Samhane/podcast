00:00 Hello Word, my name is Natalia Nerori. I am from Nicaragua, but I am currently living in Costa Rica. I'm the request manager for the Open Access Button which is giving me the amazing opportunity to experiment with challenges people face every day when getting access to science and information in general.

00:17 Science is really important to me because it is the engine that moves the world. If science is closed behind paywalls, or not accessible, people don't have access to latest discoveries and, therefore, progress stops - which means that knowledge stops; which means that education stops, and then a lot of problems emerge. 

00:41 Um, science solves problems, especially in my area, which is Public Health and Medicine. Access to clean curated scientific research and knowledge is the main tool to fight current public health outbreaks and save millions of lives. Um, it plays an essential role in global health and helps intercommunication between different scientists, um, to address the challenges, um, we are facing today and the health system is facing today.
