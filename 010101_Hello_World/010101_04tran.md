00:00  Hello World, I'm Naomi Penfold and I work at eLife as the innovation officer and I used to be a researcher, but forever biologist, interested in the brain, how we develop our behaviours, umm and interact with society around us.

00:16 At the moment I'm really interested ah in science because I think it is the way, it's the method we use to understand what's going on in the world, our bodies and to see how we can make changes and ah solve problems when things go wrong.

00:30 And I am really interested in how this is intersecting with technology; um how developers are solving problems with software, and how biologists are trying to solve problems in the body and where those kind of angles are starting to merge. And that's why I care about science right now!
