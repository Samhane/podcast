I refer to evidence-based politics, that must be our ideal. Now it is disconnection from politics I guess is the number one issue in science, assuming that every country has their characteristic, the impact indicator or impact factor, as you say it, to science are not, they are universal and are creating a cause in how to evaluate and how to use the information and how the universities' academic work is evaluated.

About the issue in innovation, I guess the access to information, to develop innovative science is main issue right now around the world.
