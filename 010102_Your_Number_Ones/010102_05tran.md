00:00 I refer to evidence ahh based politics that must be our ideal. Now ah the disconnection from politics ah I guess is the number one issue in science, assuming that every country has their characteristic, ah  the impact indictor or impact factor. As you say in science are not, ah they are universal and are creating a cause in how to evaluate and how to use the information and how the universities and academic work is evaluated.

Best regards!
