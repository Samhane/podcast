00:01 My number one issue in science today, ah is understanding why people are doing the science that they're doing and why they're behaving in their way. 

00:09 And what I would like to ask people is "Why are you publishing?", and I would like to see people being able, feeling able to publish because they want to share what they've done with others so that other people can build on it, so other people can learn and so other people can work with them on their next steps. 

00:25 But, what I feel is the issue right now is that the only feasible answer to give in the current environment is that I'm publishing because I need to publish in order to demonstrate my worth so I can continue to have a career and a job in research, and I think that is a big problem. 

00:45 K, innovation time.

00:51 Mm k.

00:53  My number one most exciting innovation ah in science today is actually quite old, but it's the World Wide Web. Because the way that it connects people, ah no matter where you are, it's incredibly inclusive - and it's actually quite simple in terms of just linking people to files, um and drawing attention to work that's already out there on stored somewhere on a server um and directing you to it. 

01:18 I think using that, really utilizing the power of the World Wide Web, to share what we know, um we're not quite there yet - we haven't done it -  to its full extent and I'm really excited to see how we can build on those ideas um using what we've already got!
