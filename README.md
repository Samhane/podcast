# The Method Podcast

The Method is an **open source, peer reviewed podcast** about the state of science. We are a team of scientists and science-lovers who want to improve the **quality, inclusivity, and productivity** of our conversations about science. 

Just as an open source community can improve the quality of code, we are creating a platform for the scientific community to improve the quality of our conversations about **what is working in science and what is not**. 

## Getting Started

As an open source podcast, **our listeners are also our content contributors**. We need scientists and science-lovers to listen to our podcast episodes and respond with their own opinions, experiences, stories, references, and constructive feedback. Here's how:

* Leave a voicemail with your contribution at **(929) 367-7330** OR
* Email a voice memo to **contact.the.method@gmail.com**

## What are we up to?

To learn more about what we are doing, refer to [The Method Roadmap](https://github.com/the-method/podcast/issues/1) for our short-, medium-, and long-term plans.
